- 👋 Hi, I’m @jen4win, but you can also call me Jennifer. 
- 👀 I’m interested in upskilling myself in Machine Learning and Image classification.
      As I have a strong biomedical background I am thrilled to use these skills to enhance health perspectives in prevention or diagnosis. 
- 🌱 I’m currently figuring out where my heart beats for in this world of data and in particular the different types of models and their strengths and weaknesses.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on health care projects. I already worked on image classification in brain tumor segmentation. Have a look at the repo: [Brain-Tumor_Segmentation_JEPSis](https://github.com/biedun/Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-JEPSis)!
      There you can also find the app for real-time diagnosis upon uploading MRI-scans.
      But I am also interested in ML projects or time-series related analysis (as for ECG, EEG,...).
